I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1 First code chunk

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2 make a plot 

This code is borrowed from last lecture; it creates a dataframe for plotting 

```{r}
plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(1000, sd = 0.5),
    y = 1 + 2 * x +rnorm(1000)
  )
```




next up is a histogram of the 'x' variable in 'plo_df'

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

lastly, i'll do a scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

#section 3: learning assessment!
```{r la_df}
la_df = 
  tibble(
    num_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
    logical_vec = num_samp > 0,
    abs_val = abs(num_samp)
  )
ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_val)) + geom_histogram()
```

#section 

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
